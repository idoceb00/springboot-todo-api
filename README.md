# To-Do List API

A simple REST API built with **Java 21**, **Spring Boot**, and **Maven**.  
The goal of this project is to learn the fundamentals of Spring Boot by creating a clean, well-structured backend application.

At this stage, the API works fully **in memory** (no database yet).  
Next steps will include adding persistence with Spring Data JPA and H2.
